<p><b>Many lawn tools are bad for the enviroment</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Despite the gas mower being much smaller than a car it is vastly ineffecint compared to one.  This is shown by the fact that two-stroke engines on gas mowers(the vast majority) <b>do not have a independent lubricant system </b>this means that the fuel and oil are mixed and about 30 percent of the fuel does not combust and instead releases toxic gasses into the air.  A 2014 study examined the VOC output from scooters with a two-stroke engine model and found that the harmfull output was 124 times higher from an idling scooter than from a car or truck.  Four-stroke engine models despite having an independent lubricant system are still bad as according to prinston.edu “A four stroke lawnmower operating for one hour equates to a vehicle traveling for 500 miles. ”.</p>
