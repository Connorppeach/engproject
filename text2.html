<p><b></b></p>
<p>Grass often requires many resources including but not limited to water, fertilizers, and pesticides.  This unneeded use of resources can cause drought, enviromental strain and can directly contribute to water polution.</p>
<p>Grass is also a very hard plant to keep alive as it generally requires 1 inch of water or rainfall per week or during the summer it can spike as high as 2.5 inches to put that into perspective 1 square foot of lawn requires 144 cubic inches of water to survive thats nearly as much as in a gallon(231 cubic inches).</p>
