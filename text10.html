<p><b>Comparing the two</b></p>
<p>Minecraft:</p>
<p>Provides a immersive experience for players to explore and have fun in.</p>
<p>Has one of the most iconic video game soundtracks of all time.</p>
<p>teaches the younger generation skills like teamwork and communication.</p>
<p>Provides an inclusive community for all groups of people via servers.</p>
<p>Allows many people to connect and find a community</p>
<p>Grass:</p>
<p>Is boring and not immersive.</p>
<p>Does not have a soundtrack and if it did it would be lame.</p>
<p>Harms the enviroment and creates a worse world for the next generation</p>
<p>Not inclusive as it often cannot be grown by people in poverty</p>
<p>Has little to no good in it community</p>
